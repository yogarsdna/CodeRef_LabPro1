# Laboratory Project - Code Refactoring

This is a repository for the Code Refactoring course for Laboratory Project.

This project was made by me and my friends back at Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember, Surabaya, for our course named Network Programming, where we are assigned to make a game, and me and my friends made a rock, paper, and scissors game.

# Laboratory Project 1
Progress:
- Add project to your GitHub (public repository) and add link to this Task.
- Find in project 6 examples of bad code and create Issues to it (as Lidia shown on first lesson).

# Laboratory Project 2
Progress:
- Create Unit tests for methods with bad code, which were found in Laboratory Project 1.

# Laboratory Project 3
Progress:
- Refactor the shortcomings that were found during Laboratory Project 2.
- For each commit, you must add a description of the procedure.
