# Lab Project 1 - Code Refactoring

This is a repository for the Code Refactoring course for Lab Project 1.

This project was made by me and my friends back at Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember, Surabaya, for our course named Network Programming, where we are assigned to make a game, and me and my friends made a rock, paper, and scissors game.
